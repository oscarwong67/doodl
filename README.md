Welcome to Doodl! A Drawing game where players take turns being assigned words to draw while others race to guess them, built using Node.js/Socket.io, and React.

# Running Doodl
You can run Doodl locally by:
1. Clone the repo and run ```npm install```
2. Run ```npm start``` && ```node server/server.js```
3. Navigate to localhost:3000

If you want to contribute, I can handle deployment of the server to heroku as well as publishing of frontend changes to gh-pages.

Thanks!
